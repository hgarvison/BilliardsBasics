			<h2>Terminology</h2>
			<dl>
				<dt>Ball-In-Hand</dt>
					<dd>When one player fouls in a game, via scratching or hitting the wrong ball (or any other non-8 ball table foul), 
					the other player may take the cue ball and place it anywhere on the table. This
					applies to any fouls made during the game, except for those made during the break
					or made on the 8-ball.</dd>
				<dt>Bank</dt>
					<dd>When a player hits the cue ball into an object ball and the object
					ball goes into a rail before going into a pocket, the player is "banking"
				<dt>Break and Run</dt>
					<dd>When a player breaks and makes something in, followed by running out the 
					rest of their balls, it is referred to as a "break and run."</dd>
				<dt>Draw</dt>
					<dd>When a player hits below center on the cue ball, they apply "draw,"
					or backwards spin.</dd>
				<dt>English</dt>
					<dd>"English" is another term for applying any kind of spin to the cue ball.</dd>
				<dt>Follow</dt>
					<dd>When a player hits above center on the cue ball, the player is applying
					forward spin, or "follow."</dd>
				<dt>"In the kitchen"</dt>
					<dd> The space behind the second diamond from the breaking end of the table.
					Better known as the area from which you are supposed to break or use ball-in-hand after the break.</dd>
				<dt>Kick</dt>
					<dd>When a player shoots the cue ball into a rail before the cue ball comes into
					contact with an object ball, they are "kicking" at the object ball.</dd>
				<dt>Miscue</dt>
					<dd>When a player strokes at the cue ball, but something causes them to not properly hit
					the cue ball. This is usually caused by not chalking their cue enough, poor form in their stroke, 
					and attempting to hit too low or too high on the cue ball.</dd>
				<dt>Pocket Speed</dt>
					<dd>The exact amount of speed required to get an object into a pocket.</dd>
				<dt>Run</dt>
					<dd>When a player pockets more than 2 balls in one turn, it is called a "run." Thus,
					a "run-out" is when a player pockets all of their remaining balls in one turn.</dd>
				<dt>Safety</dt>
					<dd>When a player makes a shot with no intention of pocketing a ball, but
					with intending to leave the other player and difficult shot.</dd>
