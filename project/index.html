				<h3>Getting Started</h3>
				<a href="http://www.poolplayers.com"><img class="indeximg" src="images/apalogo.jpg" height="171" width="228" alt="APA logo"></a>
				<p>Depending on how new to billiards you are, you should start by familiarizing yourself with the 
				tools. Then read up on the games to find out what you would like to play. Follow this up
				by reading up on terminology so that you will understand pool terminology when you hear it used in
				pool halls and instructional videos. If you want to be competitive, look into joining a local 
				league or specifically look into joining a local APA league.</p>
